# AI Data Center Energy Demand ETL Project

This project analyzes electricity consumption trends driven by the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.  
Using an ETL pipeline built with Docker and Python, the data is extracted from publicly available sources, transformed into a clean analytical format, and visualized using Tableau.

The goal is to understand how AI is influencing energy infrastructure over time, and to provide a scalable, reproducible foundation for analyzing similar trends across other domains.

## Tableau Dashboard

[Click here to view the interactive dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/AIDataCenterEnergyDemandDashboard/AIEnergyDemand)
This Tableau dashboard visualizes key trends in AI data center electricity consumption, featuring metrics such as:

- Total energy demand (TWh)
- Year-over-year (YoY) growth rates
- 3-year rolling averages
- Interactive year filters and measure toggles

### Key Insights

- 2014 Energy Demand: 58 TWh  
- 2021 Energy Demand: 130 TWh  
- 2028 Projected Demand: 325 TWh  
- YoY Growth Peak: 25% in 2024  
- Notable Decline: 19.2% to 13.6% between 2022 and 2023

##  Architecture Overview

This ETL pipeline follows a simple but effective sequence for extracting and visualizing real-world data:

Source → Python (ETL Script) → BigQuery (Storage) → Tableau (Visualization)

- Python handles data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- BigQuery stores the processed data efficiently for analysis.
- Tableau was used for visualization but no live connection to BigQuery was established.
  Instead, CSVs were uploaded to Tableau. Will do live connections to BigQuery-Tableau for future projects.

This visual flow helps stakeholders and engineers quickly understand how data flows through the pipeline, from raw input to business insights.
